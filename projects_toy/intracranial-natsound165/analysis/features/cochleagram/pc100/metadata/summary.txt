Time window: 1 second before to 1 second after;
The dimensions of the matrices: [time, pc];
The sampling rate of the features: 25 Hz;
Code used to generate those features are here: https://github.com/Sigurd-git/feature_extraction/tree/main/code/utils;
Extra comments: Weights are saved to feature_extraction/projects_toy/intracranial-natsound165/analysis/features/cochleagram/pc100/metadata/pca_weights.mat
You can reconstruct (nearly) the original features by reading in the US from the stimname files and multiply by V^T
In python:
feature = hdf5storage.loadmat(stim_file)["features"]
Vt = hdf5storage.loadmat(pca_weights_file)["V"]
original_feature = np.matmul(feature, V.T)
.
